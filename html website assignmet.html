<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi,My name is Edwin Nsarko Biney,and this is my life story.</p>
I was in Tema Accra,and grew up in Adjumako which is my hometown.I am 18 years old and from a young age i was always fascinated by computers and how they work.
My curiosity led me to explore coding,starting with simple scripts and eventually moving on to more complex programming languages.I still remember the first time I wrote a program that actually worked,that was what sparked a deeper passion for me to explore computers even more.
I am currently pursuing my education in Knust Nkrumah University of Science and Technology,i am however an old student a Presbyterian Boys Secondary School.My dream is to become a skilled computer engineer who can take on the hardest tech issues.
My journey as an aspiring computer engineer is just beginning.I know there will be challenges ahead,but I am ready to face them with determination and enthusiasm.Every piece of 
code i write,every problem i solve,and every skill that i learn brings me one step closer to my goal.I am excited for what the future holds
and eager to keep growing in this ever-evolving field.
